# "#COMET Q4FY24-25 Up-Skilling Goal" - Playwright and Javascript
Here I kept all the documents and learning content

Month 1 : Last Month Pendencies and Playwright

Week 1-2 : Pendencies From Previous Goals
Playwright:- Emulating Devices and Cross-Browser Testing
1 Focus on emulating devices:
  - Use Playwright’s built-in devices (e.g., iPhone, Galaxy) to test mobile responsiveness.
  - Practice writing tests that check different screen sizes and resolutions.
2 Set up cross-browser testing:
  - Run your tests across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

Jmeter:-
1. Logic Controllers- Throughput Controller
2. Building a distributed Load Test
3. Parameterization, CSV Dataset Config, User Defined Variables
4. Correlation with Regular Expression Extractor
 
Weeks 3-4: API and Performance Testing in Playwright
1. API Testing: Learn to make API requests (`request.get`, `request.post`) and validate responses.  

2. Mocking Requests: Use Playwright to intercept and mock network requests for testing edge cases.  

3. Performance Timing: Track page performance metrics like load time using Playwright’s `page.metrics()` method.  

4. Accessibility Testing: Use Playwright’s built-in tools and libraries (like axe-core) for accessibility validation.  

5. Visual Testing: Explore visual comparison tools like pixel match for UI regression testing.


Month 2 : Javascript Language

Week 5-6 : Basics
1. Functions:
   - Learn to declare and call functions.
   - Understand the difference between function declarations and expressions.
   - Explore arrow functions (`=>`) and the concept of parameters and return values.

2. DOM Manipulation:
   - Learn how to select elements using `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll`.
   - Understand how to add, remove, and modify HTML elements and attributes.
   - Learn how to handle events (e.g., `click`, `mouseover`, `submit`) with `addEventListener`.

Week 7-8 : Advanced Basics

1. Objects and Arrays:
   - Learn how to create and manipulate objects and arrays.
   - Explore object properties, array methods (`push`, `pop`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`).

2. JavaScript in the Browser:
   - Understand how to work with `window` and `document` objects.
   - Learn about timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`).

3. Introduction to Asynchronous JavaScript:
   - Learn about `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and callbacks.
   - Understand the concept of asynchronous execution.


Month 3 : Advanced Javascript

Week 9-10 : Mastering Core JavaScript Concepts

1. Promises and Async/Await:
   - Understand how to create and handle promises (`then`, `catch`, `finally`).
   - Learn how to use `async` and `await` for cleaner asynchronous code.

2. Classes and Inheritance:
   - Learn about ES6 classes and how to define constructors, methods, and properties.
   - Understand prototypal inheritance and how to extend classes.

3. Modules:
   - Learn how to split your code into modules using `export` and `import`.

4. Error Handling Best Practices:
   - Explore throwing custom errors and handling specific error scenarios.

Weeks 11-12: Working with APIs and Tools

1. Project on above learning
